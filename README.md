# Diagrammar: A Graphical Programming Language

Diagrammar is an experimental graphical programming environment. It is a Dataflow language, with values flowing along graph edges, and functions represented as graph nodes. Since functions can be created and instantiated, more complex programs can be built. This introduction shows how Quicksort and some other classic algorithms can be built, and hopefully demonstrates the advantages of this approach.

## Data Flow programming review

Dataflow diagrams are a graphical programming method where data processing elements, represented by graph nodes, are connected by edges that represent data transfer. The graph is like an electrical circuit, and the advantage is that data flow can more easily be visualized as a graph.

Most data flow systems model restricted domains, and have limited ability to represent abstractions. Diagrammar adds a way to easily define and use new families of functions, and to create abstractions that make the diagrams more widely useful.

## Building expressions and grouping

For now, let's imagine a language with one value type, which can represent numbers, strings, arrays, or other types of objects. This makes our circuits simpler, with only one primitive wire and pin type. Circuit elements for built-in operations can be provided by the language, and combined to form useful expressions.

<figure>

</figure>

On the top row is the literal element, with no inputs and a single output. Literals can represent numbers, strings and other value types. Next are the unary and binary functions, and the only 3-ary function, the conditional operator.

In addition there are "junction" elements, which are used to describe imports and exports.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/palette2.svg"  alt="" title="Primitive elements (junctions)">
</figure>

We can combine these primitive functions to compute simple expressions. In the diagrams below, we are creating:

1. An increment by 1.
1. A decrement by 1.
1. A binary minimum and maximum using a relational operator and the conditional operator (note how input junctions are used to tie inputs together.)
1. A 3-ary and 4-ary addition operation by cascading binary additions.

Note that there is fan-out but no fan-in in our circuit graphs. There are no cycles, so the circuit is a DAG (directed acyclic graph). Each circuit element is conceptually a function and wires connect outputs of one function to inputs of another. Evaluation proceeds left-to-right, since inputs must be evaluated before producing outputs. The evaluation order of the graph is only partially ordered (by topologically sorting) so we have to take extra care when a specific sequential evaluation order is required.

Expressions can be used to build more complex diagrams, but this quickly leads to large, unreadable graphs. A better way is to turn expressions into new functions, which allow us to program at a higher level of abstraction. Grouping is how we create new functions. In this diagram, we take the expressions above and group them to form new functions that we can use just like the primitive ones. Each group is a separate context, denoted by a dotted boundary. New elements an be dragged and dropped into the context. Disconnected inputs or outputs become the new function's inputs and outputs. Input and output junctions can be connected to inputs and outputs in order to assign names to them. They can also be used to identify common inputs, since ordinarily each disconnected input leads to a unique group input. The "min" and "max" functions use input junctions this way.

Here's another example, cascading conditional functions to create more complex conditionals, where the inputs are successive pairs of <condition, value> tuples.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/basic_grouping2.png"  alt="" title="Basic Grouping">
</figure>

We can use these new functions just like the built in ones to create more complex functions. Here's the sgn function, which takes a single number as input and returns 1 if it's > 0, 0 if it's equal to 0, or -1 if it's less than 0. On the right, we build it from primitive functions. However, it's clearer if we create helper functions: "less than 0" and "greater than 0" functions, and a 5 input conditional.

</figure>

## Function Abstraction

We have to rebuild these graphs every time we want to create a similar function, for example cascading binary multiplication or logical operations. To make the graph representation more powerful, any function can be abstracted. This adds an input value, of the same type as the function, to indicate that the function is merely a "shell" and the function body is imported. This operation is called "opening" the function. This allows us to create functions that takes other functions as inputs. Here, we use have abstracted two binary addition operations and identified both function inputs to create a cascaded 3-ary operation that takes a single binary function as an additional input.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/function_abstraction.png"  alt="" title="Function Abstraction">
</figure>

We can nest function definitions to avoid repetition definitions. Before we stated that any disconnected inputs and outputs become group inputs and outputs. One exception to this rule is when we add instances of the new function to its own context. This allows us to create many interesting things. Here, we create a single abstract binary operation, and then cascade it to create 3-ary, 4-ary, 5-ary, and 6-ary functions by grouping these into nested function definitions.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/function_abstraction2.png"  alt="" title="Function Abstraction (nested)">
</figure>

## Function Creation

Now we need a way to create functions that can be imported. The mechanism is function closure. Any function element can be closed, which creates a function output whose type is all disconnected inputs, and all outputs. This is exactly analogous to function closure in regular programming languages. In the diagram below, we can create an incrementing function by grouping as before, or by partially applying addition to a literal 1 value and closing to get a unary incrementing function.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/function_creation.png"  alt="" title="Function Creation">
</figure>

Using closure, we can take our abstract 3-ary cascading function from before, and specialize it for addition. We combine it with an addition with no inputs which we close to get a binary output function. We connect it and add pins for the 4 inputs and 1 output.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/function_creation3.png"  alt="" title="Function Creation (continued)">
</figure>

We need one more special element to apply a function that has been imported, the Lambda element. This takes a function input and expands to an element with that functions inputs and outputs which can then be used in the graph like any other element.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/function_application.png"  alt="" title="Function Application">
</figure>

Function closing is a powerful graph simplification mechanism. Imagine we wanted to apply our quadratic polynomial evaluation function to one polynomial at 4 different x values. Using the grouped expression 4 times leads to a complex graph that is becoming unwieldy. Applying the function to the polynomial coefficients and closing gives a simple unary function that we can apply 4 times, which is easier to understand.

## Iteration

Iteration can be challenging in a data flow system. Let's start with everyone's favorite toy example, the factorial function.

### Factorial

We can create most of this with simple operations, but we get stuck at the recursive part. We need to use the function that we're in the middle of creating. The solution is to provide a special proto-function operation. A part of the graph can be selected, and a proto-function element will be created that matches what would be created from the selection by the normal grouping operation. This proto-function element can then be used in the graph to represent recursion. This will also be our mechanism for iteration in a moment.

  <img src="/resources/factorial.png"  alt="" title="Iteration with Factorials">
</figure>

### Fibonacci

Similarly, we can implement a Fibonacci function that returns the i'th number in the sequence with a slightly more complex recursion.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/fibonacci.png"  alt="" title="Iteration with Fibonacci Numbers">
</figure>


### Generic iteration

Let's try a more typical iteration, equivalent to the following for loop in Javascript. Let's try to add the numbers in the range [0..n].

```js
let acc = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
	acc += i;
}
return acc;
```

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/iteration.png"  alt="" title="Iteration to add numbers from i to n">
</figure>

Summing an integer range isn't really useful, and it would be cumbersome to have to create these graphs every time we wanted to iterate over a range of integers. But we can abstract the binary operation at the heart of this to create a generic iteration over an integer range that is more useful.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/iteration2.png"  alt="" title="Iteration to apply binary op to range">
</figure>

Using this more generic function, we can easily create a factorial function.

## State

So far we haven't used the ability to pass functions as parameters very much. However, they make it possible to express many different things besides expressions. Let's introduce three new stateful elements, which allow us to hold state and "open" values as objects or arrays.

1. On the left is the "let" element, which outputs a value and an assignment function. The value is the current value of the assignment, while the function takes an input and replaces the old value which is returned. This is convenient as we'll see in a moment.
2. In the middle is the "object" adapter, which takes a value as input and returns two functions. The first is the "getter" which takes a key value as input and returns a value. The second is the "setter" which takes a key and value, updates that field of the object and returns the previous value.
3. On the right is the "array" adapter, which takes an object and returns the length, a "getter" function which takes an index and returns the value at that index, and a setter function which takes an index and value, updates the array at that index and returns the previous value.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/state.png"  alt="" title="Stateful objects">
</figure>

State allows us to perform more complex computations. Let's sum the elements of an array. To do this, we need to define a binary function similar to the one we created to sum integers in a range. This time, the function will use the iteration index to access the array value at the ith position. TODO update diagram.

<figure>
  <img src="/resources/state_and_iteration.png"  alt="" title="Iteration over stateful object">
</figure>

In the top left, we apply the array getter, and pass it as the first operand of an addition. We add pins for the inputs that come from the iteration. This can be grouped and closed to create a function import for our iteration. On the bottom we hook it up, set the range to [0..n-1] and pass an initial 'acc' of 0.

Using state is tricky in a graphical program without the normal sequential evaluation of an imperative language. Let's make an element to swap two "let" values. We start with two let values, and invoke their assignments. This is tricky. We can't simply assign the values in parallel because one will be evaluated first, clobbering the other. Instead, we take advantage of the assignment which returns the old value. We feed that into the second assignment, which is thus guaranteed to be evaluated after by the graph topology. There are other ways to represent sequencing which we'll see later. TODO

## Quicksort

Quicksort is challenging to implement graphically. Let's try. Here is the source for a Javascript implementation of Quicksort which does the partition step in place. We'll start by implementing the iterations which advance indices to a pair of out of place elements.

```js
function partition(a, i, j) {
  let p = a[i];
  while (1) {
    while (a[i] < p) i++;
    while (a[j] > p) j--;
    if (i >= j) return j;
    [a[i], a[j]] = [a[j], a[i]];
    i++; j--;
  }
}
function qsort(a, i, j) {
  if (i >= j) return;
  let k = partition(a, i, j);
  qsort(a, i, k);
  qsort(a, k + 1, j);
}
```
